        # Unbinding Bodes
          **Unbinding Bodies** swiftly captures the fissures in the process where the human body, technology, consciousness, life, perception, and existence are mutually excessive and deficient. This fissure is understood as a transition from a closed to an open world, surpassing the self-contained characteristics of Western metaphysics.

          Visitors to the exhibition will experience their own senses and perceptions oscillating between excess and lack as they themselves bind and separate from technology through the work <Extruded Body> (2024). They can also track the relational encounters of various heterogeneous subjects through the performance work <≈> (2024).

        > I designed the end to end Computer Vision software for the exhibition. The software was used to track the faces of visitors and move the robot arms accordingly. Another algorithm was used to display what an AI sees when it looks at the humans.

        #### Paragraph

        **William Shakespeare**,
        hello hi 
         Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
